I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working with [Professor Kaushik Roy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=to4P8KgAAAAJ&hl=en). I also received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University  and my B.E. in Electronics and Communications from PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India.

My doctoral dissertation, "**Exploring Data Efficiency for Deep Learning Systems**" aims to make deep learning more practical and scalable. My research focuses on optimizing data utilization across various facets of these systems, including enhancing training data efficiency by identifying critical data subsets, improving communication strategies and privacy in federated learning environments, and leveraging unique sensor data for real-time processing in autonomous applications.

I've presented aspects of my research, including ['DOTIE: Energy-Efficient Object Detection Using Event Cameras'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00975), at forums such as the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)  and [CVPR workshops](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/EventVision/html/Roy_Live_Demonstration_Real-Time_Event-Based_Speed_Detection_Using_Spiking_Neural_Networks_CVPRW_2023_paper.html). You can find my publications, including ['TOFU: Federated Learning with Data and Communication Efficiency'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10504799}) which was published in IEEE Access, and preprints of ongoing work like ['Finding the Muses: Identifying Coresets through Loss Trajectories'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09721) on arXiv.

My main interests are data efficiency and optimization techniques in machine learning, with a specific emphasis on creating compact, accurate, and scalable machine learning systems. The concept of reducing computational overhead while enhancing system performance for real-world applications is a major theme in my work.
