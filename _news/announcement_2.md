I'm excited to announce "DOTIE - Detecting Objects through Temporal Isolation of Events using a Spiking Architecture" has been accepted for presentation at the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), London, UK, and for inclusion in the conference proceedings IEEE RAS ICRA.
 
This work presents a novel approach to performing object detection using bioinspired event-based cameras. The algorithm leverages the temporal information present in the events and a single-layer spiking architecture to isolate objects based on their speed of movement.
